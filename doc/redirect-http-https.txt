opensubtitles.org sends 2 redirects

1.
  from https://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/subs
  to    http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/captcha2/redirect-%7Cen%7Csearch%7Csubs

2.
  from http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/captcha2/redirect-%7Cen%7Csearch%7Csubs
  to   http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/captcha/redirect-%7Cen%7Csearch%7Csubs

and the only relevant response i get is
responseReceived response_url=https://www.opensubtitles.org/en/captcha/redirect-%7Cen%7Csearch%7Csubs response_status=429

which only differs in protocol: http vs https
 http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/captcha/redirect-%7Cen%7Csearch%7Csubs
https://www.opensubtitles.org/en/captcha/redirect-%7Cen%7Csearch%7Csubs

so we need fuzzy url matching in responseReceived
because chromium can either/or

- actually use http protocol from redirect
- upgrade from http to https protocol
